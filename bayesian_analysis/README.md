# Bayesian Analysis

Bayesian analysis is a statistical approach that allows us to update our beliefs and make predictions based on new evidence. In a Bayesian analysis course, we learned the foundational principles of Bayesian statistics, including prior and posterior distributions, Bayesian inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and Bayesian model selection.

## Project abstract
This educational project aims to analyze and measure the predictive accuracy of macroeconomic data in the US using the Bayesian Vector Autoregressive Model (BVAR). The Bayesian VAR model enables the incorporation of prior information into the model, which improves its predictive accuracy. On the other hand, the frequentist VAR model does not incorporate prior information and relies solely on the observed data. The project aims to compare the accuracy of both models in predicting macroeconomic variables such as inflation, unemployment, and economic growth in the US.
We will collect and analyze data, build, and test the Bayesian VAR model, and compare its performance with the frequentist VAR model. The results of the project will be used to determine the effectiveness of the Bayesian VAR model in predicting macroeconomic variables and its potential applications in macroeconomic forecasting.

## Project structure
All experiment results with simple VAR(p) model can be found in [var_baseline.ipynb](./var_baseline.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook whereas the same for BVAR(p) is located in [bvar_baseline.ipynb](./bvar_baseline.ipynb).
